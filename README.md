# [Learn Scales](https://colorlessred.github.io/learnscales/showScales.html)

A very simple, but somewhat difficult, exercise that has been very useful to me.

See it here: [Learn Scales](https://colorlessred.github.io/learnscales/showScales.html) and click the "Start / Pause" button to Start.

The application plays ascending and descending lines, changing scale root every four notes and always going the next closest available note. The notes are costrained to one position on the guitar. Once the top note is reached the scale starts descending, once the lowest note is reached the scale start ascending.

## Features
- plays the sounds straight from the browser
- can change the fretboard position
- shows the scale and current root
- displays the name next root
- variable speed
- various scales available
